Special thanks to my friend Jena, an excellent UI/UX designer, who has provided me with valuable UI suggestions throughout this project. It has been my first time collaborating with a UI/UX designer, and it has taught me how to effectively communicate and coordinate with designers, resulting in the creation of outstanding work.
